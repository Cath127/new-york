# **THRIFTY NYC Website**
The THRIFTY NYC Website is designed to be responsive and accessible on a range of devices.  It allows visitors to find out more about New York.  The site has been built using HTML5, CSS3 and Bootstrap for the Milestone 1 project for Code Institute's diploma in Web Development.

## User Experience (UX)
### Reasoning
The purpose of me building this wesbite is that New York, live most cities, is an expensive destination to visit.  THRIFTY NYC is meant to showcase the free and discounted things to do and see in New York that are not well known to many tourists.
